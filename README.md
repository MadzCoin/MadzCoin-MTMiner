# Note
For this to work you have to install web3 module. In linux you need to have Python3.9 if it gives you an error you will need python3.9 dev version. and in windows you will need python3.9 minimum and latest version of Microsoft C++ Build tools Follow [This](https://docs.siricoin.tech/how-to-mine-siri-using-pcminer) guide if you want to mine on windows

# How to Use
So based on your operating system download the miner in the releases page, for Arm and Macos please read the "readme before you mine.md" file before you mine. You could choose the original miner or the optimised (Ridimuim) version of the miner as per your needs, But if you want to mine with all your CPU threads (MultiThreaded) then you can use the SiriCoinPCMiner (Ridimuim) MT version however its not recommended to use this file as its still in Beta and you may get errors while running or it might not work at all
